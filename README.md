# MorseCode-useArduino  
This is a simple and single Morse code use Arduino  
To use this code you neet to prepare ï¼š  
1.Arduino (I use UNO , if you use different board you neet to search I2C port in which pin)  
2.inching switch in Pin 7   
3.ICD use I2C in pin  A4 A5 (different Arduino board have different I2C Pin)  
4.LED in Pin 6  
5.Downlod LiquidCrystal_I2C Library in https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library  

and enjoy you Morse code
